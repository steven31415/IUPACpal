1. Determine why there are 339 incorrect palindromes when running:

python tools/check_correctness.py tests/input_rand100000.txt IUPACpal.out 5

2. Confirm correctness when running on IUPAC sequences

3. Add timing functionality

4. Timing tests for both programs on increasing sizes of random data, and real data.
Include resulting palindromes found and overlap in the 2 outputs for each test.

5. Send results to Samir/Mai
