Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool, a C++
compiler, and the libraries: libdivsufsort and sdsl. Ensure the cmake tool
and a C++ compiler are installed before proceeding with the below instructions.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort and sdsl with the included
installer via the command:

$ ./pre-install.sh 


Basic Instructions
==================

By default, the program may be compiled via the command:

$ make -f Makefile.gcc

This will compile the program for 64-bit integers using the recommended type
of Range Minimum Queries (rmq1). This requires double the amount of memory as
32-bit integers. There are alternative makefiles available in the Makesfiles
folder.

After compilation the binary 'IUPACpal' will be created in the working
directory, you may call it from this directory via the command:

$ ./IUPACpal <arguments>

Run the above command without any arguments, to print basic documentation of
arguments.
